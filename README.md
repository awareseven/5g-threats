# pentest5g
This is the collection of threats identified in the Pentest Guide. The collection is implemented on top of MITRE ATT&CK Enterprise, so organizations can directly add these threats to their existing MITRE ATT&CK workflow.

You can view and edit the file with the [MITRE ATT&CK workbench](https://github.com/center-for-threat-informed-defense/attack-workbench-frontend)
